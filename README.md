# Project Overview

The Applied-Analytics repository contains a series of case studies and reports developed to demonstrate data analysis techniques, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and visualization. The project is designed for data analysts, data scientists, and enthusiasts interested in applying analytics to real-world datasets.

# Files Description

Case study 3.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook containing a comprehensive case study, exploring "OnlineNewsPopularity.csv" to perform supervised learning using K-Nearest Neighbors to predict the number of shares in social networks that demonstrate the popularity of an article published by Mashable in a period of two years. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling.

report 1.ipynb, report 2.ipynb, report 3.ipynb: These three reports show the process behind the Applied Analytics Final Report pdf. How pre-processing was done, and what steps were taken to derive any conclusions found in the report. 

Applied Analytics final report.pdf: A PDF document summarizing the key findings, methodologies, and conclusions from "GetEmployedForum.Csv". This file serves as a comprehensive overview of the project's outcomes.

# Usage
